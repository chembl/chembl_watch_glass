# chembl_watch_glass
In chemistry, a watch glass is a glass surface used as a cover for beaker. Similarily this project aims to provide online drag and drop area, where you can compose chemistry pipelines by arranging set of graphical nodes and connecting them together. Each node, under the hood will make a call to beaker web services and pass the results to another node.

This is very much just an idea, proof of concept and work in progress.
